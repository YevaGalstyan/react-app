**React Redux Typescript Webpack App**

---

### Description
This is a ReactJS application built with Webpack, Typescript, and Redux. The app features a "Home" page where users' data is displayed in a table. Each row in the table includes options to edit and delete the user's information. Additionally, there is a "Create" button that opens a modal window with input fields for first name, last name, and age. Users can add new entries to the table by saving the input data. The application interacts with a local database file (db.json) to store and retrieve user information.
